Saturn V was an American super heavy-lift launch vehicle certified for human-rating used
by NASA between 1967 and 1973. It consisted of three stages, each fueled by liquid propellants.
It was developed to support the Apollo program for human exploration of the Moon and was later
used to launch Skylab, the first American space station. As of 2021, the Saturn V remains the tallest,
heaviest, and most powerful (highest total impulse) rocket ever brought to operational status, and holds
records for the heaviest payload launched and largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit (LEO) of
 310,000 lb (140,000 kg), which included the third stage and unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo
  command and service module and Lunar Module to the Moon. To date, the Saturn V remains the only launch
  vehicle to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 15 flight-capable vehicles were built, but
   only 13 were flown. An additional three vehicles were built for ground testing purposes. A total of
   24 astronauts were launched to the Moon in the four years spanning December 1968 through December
   1972
